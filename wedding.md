### Saturday 25th June 2016 – The Wedding

The ceremony is at 2pm and since Katie doesn’t plan on making Chris wait too long guests should arrive 30 minutes before to allow time to be seated.

The reception is at the same location and will follow the ceremony.

**Carriages:** 23:15

**Dress Code:** Lounge suits

### Sunday 26th June 2016 – The Garden Party

For many of you we will be dragging you down a long way from home. We really appreciate that and would love to invite you back to the castle for a Garden Party and BBQ on the Sunday.

This will be a relaxed gathering to enjoy the castle, the beautiful dorset coastline and fingers crossed the weather a little more before the reality of Monday morning. If you’d like to come to this, please just let us know in the RSVP so we know how many we are catering for.

**Start:** 12:00

**Finish:** 15:00

**Dress code:** Casual
