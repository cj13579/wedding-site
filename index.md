Thanks for stopping by! We hope that you’ll be able to join us on the 25th June 2016 at Pennsylvania Castle, Dorset for our ceremony followed by an evening of awesome food and drink and some less awesome dancing!

On this site you should find everything you need to know, what to wear, when and where to go and what to expect. If you have any questions though, you know how to get in touch 🙂

### The proposal

For once in his life, Chris actually managed to surprise Katie and do something she wasn’t expecting. He had been looking casually at engagement rings but while he was on a work trip Dallas, TX he visited a jewellery store and made an impulse purchase of a ring that was perfect.

Two weeks later, after the ring had been buried deep inside the smelliest of sock drawers, Chris joined Katie for a long weekend in New York from where they flew to Bermuda for the rest of the week. On Thursday evening, as the sun went down, they went for a walk on Elbow Beach where Chris asked ‘the question’.

Katie still hasn’t verbally answered the question yet but Chris took the ferociously nodding head as a yes. They then went and enjoyed some champagne at the bar a little further up the beach. The following day, Chris utterly destroyed Katie at mini golf putting to bed any rumour that she had once beaten him whilst on holiday in Skegness.
